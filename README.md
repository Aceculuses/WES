# Best Practice for Germline Variants (SNP/InDel) discovery AND functional annotation
To find short gene mutations using whole exome sequencing, it is recommend to follow the workflow of GATK4 and Annovar. [GATK4](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us) is a famous widely-used tools developed by the Broad Instituite for detecting mutations, and it holds a indusctry standard. Annovar can help you to annotate a variety of databases onto your VCF files.
